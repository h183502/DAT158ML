# Notebooks
The course is based on Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework to write and present code-based projects. Have a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for two short introductions to Jupyter Notebooks.

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks containing various material and coding exercises. _It is recommended to make copies of the course notebooks before editing_. You can follow the naming convention `my_[name_of_original_notebook].ipynb`.
